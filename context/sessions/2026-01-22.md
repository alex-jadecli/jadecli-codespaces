# Session: 2026-01-22

## Overview

Initial setup of jadecli-codespaces repository for multi-agent collaboration.

## Environment

- **Primary WSL**: 26.04-jadecli (planned)
- **Current WSL**: Ubuntu on WSL2
- **Codespace**: alex-jadecli/jadecli-codespaces

## Work Done

### Repository Setup
- [x] Created GitHub repo: alex-jadecli/jadecli-codespaces
- [x] Set up devcontainer.json for Codespaces
- [x] Created CLAUDE.md with file locking documentation
- [x] Implemented checkout/checkin commands
- [x] Added pre-edit and post-edit hooks
- [x] Created initial context file structure

### File Locking System
- Frontmatter-based locking mechanism
- Commands: /checkout, /checkin, /lock-status
- Hooks for edit validation and logging

## Decisions Made

1. **Frontmatter for locks** - Using YAML frontmatter instead of external lock files
   - Reason: Self-contained, works with git, visible in file
2. **Agent ID format** - `hostname-hash` pattern
   - Reason: Unique enough, human-readable source

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should locks auto-expire after N hours?
- [ ] Need integration with claude-assist PostgreSQL?
- [ ] How to handle merge conflicts in frontmatter?

## Next Steps

1. Test multi-agent workflow with two Claude sessions
2. Set up sync scripts between WSL and Codespace
3. Create initial knowledge base files
