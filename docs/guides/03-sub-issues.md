# Sub-Issues

> Break parent issues into child tasks with hierarchical tracking.

## Key Concepts
- Sub-issues nest under parent issues
- Create new or attach existing issues as sub-issues
- Can search across repos when adding existing issues
- Progress fields available in Projects for filtering/grouping
- Requires triage permissions

## CLI Commands
```bash
# No CLI support for sub-issues
# Manage via web UI only
```

## Limits
- **Max 100 sub-issues** per parent
- **Max 8 nesting levels** deep
