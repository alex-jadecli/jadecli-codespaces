# Quickstart for Projects

> Create a project, add items, configure fields, and set up basic automation in minutes.

## Key Concepts

- Projects support three layouts: Table, Board, Roadmap
- Add items by pasting issue/PR URLs or typing draft issues directly
- Custom fields: Iteration (sprints), Single Select (priority), Number (estimates)
- Built-in workflows auto-set status when items are added or closed

## Creating a Project

1. Navigate to org/user profile > Projects tab
2. Click "New project"
3. Select layout or template
4. Name the project
5. Optionally import items from a repository

## Adding Items

- Paste issue/PR URL in bottom row, press Enter
- Type text directly to create draft issues
- Use `#` to search by number or title

## Adding Fields

- Click `+` in rightmost header > "New field"
- Field types: Text, Number, Date, Single Select, Iteration

## Workflows

- **Auto-add**: Automatically adds issues matching criteria (e.g., specific labels)
- **Item added**: Sets status to "Todo" when items are added

## CLI Commands

```bash
# No dedicated quickstart CLI commands
