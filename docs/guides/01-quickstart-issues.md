# GitHub Issues Quickstart

> Issues track work items with metadata, hierarchy, and dependencies.

## Key Concepts
- Issues = units of work (bugs, features, tasks, ideas)
- Enrich with labels, milestones, assignees, projects, issue types
- Break down via sub-issues; define blocking relationships
- Collaborate with @mentions and `#issue-title` cross-references
- Requires write access to repo with issues enabled

## CLI Commands
```bash
# No CLI covered in quickstart - see 02-creating-issue.md
```
