# Issue Types

> Classify issues at the organization level (Task, Bug, Feature, custom).

## Key Concepts
- Default types: Task, Bug, Feature (editable/deletable)
- Custom types: name, description, color
- Disable = hide type, existing issues keep it
- Delete = permanent removal
- Filterable in search and Projects
- Org owners only can manage

## CLI Commands
```bash
# No CLI support for issue types
# Manage via: Org Settings > Planning > Issue types
```

## Limits
- **Max 25 custom issue types** per organization
